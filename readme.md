# Email Sync Application
## Overview

The Email Sync Application is designed for organizations to manage and synchronize email communication between users and guests. Admins can assign tasks, and users can structure and send emails, with statuses and histories tracked for auditing. This application leverages Spring Boot for backend logic and Thymeleaf for the user interface.
Features

    Task Assignment: Admins can assign tasks to users.
    Email Structuring: Users can create structured emails to be sent to guests.
    Status Tracking: Track the status of tasks (e.g., Pending, Completed).
    Notification System: Notify users when tasks are assigned or updated.
    History Logs: Record and view task-related activities.
    Autogenerated User Credentials: Usernames and passwords are autogenerated upon account creation.

## Idea

The core idea of the Email Sync Application is to create a structured, trackable workflow for email-based tasks within an organization, centered around distinct roles and tables to manage the process.

Key Workflow:

1. Task Assignment by Admin: The Admin assigns tasks, and each assignment is stored in the Notification Table.


2. Email Structuring by Coordinator: After receiving the notification, the assigned Coordinator structures the content for the email and stores it in the Structure Table. This ensures that each email follows a standardized, professional format.


3. Email Status Tracking: Once the email is sent, it moves to the Status Table, where the system tracks whether the email has been accepted, rejected, or is pending. A key feature is that the recipient (like an expert or guest) can click a button in the email to update its status.


4. History and Public Access: After the status is confirmed, the interaction is recorded in the History Table for future reference. Certain interactions can be made public, allowing access to relevant users or departments.



## Why It Stands Out:

Streamlined Flow: Each task follows a structured path from creation to completion, ensuring no step is missed.

Role-Specific Actions: The process is managed through different roles (Admin, Coordinator) with clear responsibilities at each stage.

End-to-End Tracking: Each email's journey from creation to response is fully tracked, ensuring accountability and transparency.

Automated Status Confirmation: Recipients can directly update the email status, integrating real-time feedback into the system.


This structured, automated flow significantly reduces manual effort, improves communication transparency, and enhances accountability across the organization.
